The overcast heavens clear,A flame long extinguished,
Flickers once more, growing in size.
An entity lost in the darkness of time,
White teeth clad in midnight black,
Striking on the strings of harmony,
The sheets come unraveled.
A tidal wave bursts from my heart,
My weightless fingertips dance,
Wings start to flutter,
Doves free in the wilderness,
No more constraints.
The center of a thousand stares,
A moment of silence,
Then a grand round of applause,
As my candle melts to its last.
